# blogpost-project

The far most easy project throughout my Masterschool program, as our responsive blogpage consisted of just HTML and CSS. But don't underestimate that! CSS grid can be quite tricky, and it took me several tries to make it as perfect as possible. I am a huge fan of colors, design and therefore CSS - and so I had tons of fun creating my meow blog! 🐈
